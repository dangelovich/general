IT Operations Principles
------------------------
- Sustainability
  - Everything needs to be set up to comply with other principles for its useful life.
- Supportability
  - If we can't suppport it, it shouldn't exist
  - Support means its documented, has proper DR/capacity planning etc.
  - Its generally in a state that it won't cause any issues for the predictable future
- Scalability
  - It should work now, and for the predictable future
  - What do we do when its too big/popular/slow?
- Planning
  - Understand where we are now
  - Understand where we want to be in various timeframes (6mo/1y/3y/5y)
  - Have a plan for how to get from A to B to C to D
  - The plan can change - its not static
- Reduce Duplication and Improve Process
  - Will this ever be done again?
  - What's the time/cost of doing this over a longer period?
  - Is it worth investing in early?
- Documentation
  - Don't just document what, document why
  - Add value rather than reproduce - if we followed the manual, just document what was specific to us, rather than the entire procedure
  - Search is more important than structure - we generally don't browse/navigate to documentation
  - Keep it consistent - have a documentation standard and reference pages for best practise. Don't use personal color schemes or styles.
  - Documentation isn't a place for jokes, unnecessary images, etc.
  - Post relevant images only. Restrict screenshots to the minimum relevant area (you don't need the whole screenshot to show just a window). Ensure the quality/resolution is reasonable.
- Standards
  - If its not enforced, its not a standard
  - Use the monitoring system to detect and enforce standards
  - If the process/tool allows you to differ from the standard, the process/tool is broken
  - Create systems where doing things the right way is the only way to get it done
