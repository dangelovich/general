IT Operations Principles
------------------------
- Sustainability
  - Everything needs to be set up to comply with other principles for its useful life.
- Supportability
  - If we can't suppport it, it shouldn't exist
  - Support means its documented, has proper DR/capacity planning etc.
  - Its generally in a state that it won't cause any issues for the predictable future
- Scalability
  - It should work now, and for the predictable future
  - What do we do when its too big/popular/slow?
- Planning
  - Understand where we are now
  - Understand where we want to be in various timeframes (6mo/1y/3y/5y)
  - Have a plan for how to get from A to B to C to D
  - The plan can change - its not static
- Reduce Duplication and Improve Process
  - Will this ever be done again?
  - What's the time/cost of doing this over a longer period?
  - Is it worth investing in early?
